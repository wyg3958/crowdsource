Documentation
=============

Modules
-------
crowdsource-frontend
The frontend-module contains the angularjs client app along with js-tests for it. It will be bundled in a jar file and then integrated into the core-app.

crowdsource-core
The core-module contains the backend for crowdsource. It integrates the resources-jar generated by frontend-module.

crowdsource-example
Example crowdsource-application. You can use this as a basis for your own build.

crowdsource-integrationtests
Some end-to-end-, integration-, acceptance-, blackbox-, you-name-it-tests.


Example developer run config
----------------------------
java -jar crowdsource-example.jar


Token signing
-------------
CrowdSource uses JWT with a token signing key. These (tokensigningkey/tokensigningkey.pub) must be present under /src/main/resources.
You can generate a pair of your own using ssh-keygen.


Persistence
-----------
CrowdSource uses MongoDB. You should provide the DB hosts comma-separated via property de.asideas.crowdsource.db.hosts.
Eg java -jar ... -Dde.asideas.crowdsource.db.hosts=hosta,hostb,hostc
For local development you can use the embed-mongo-maven-plugin that is used in the integrationstests as well.
Simply run 
`mvn com.github.joelittlejohn.embedmongo:embedmongo-maven-plugin:0.1.12:start -Dembedmongo.wait -Dmongodb.test.port=27017` 
in the crowdsource-integrationtests module.

For configuration your own application:
- Create a appication.properties with following entries
> de.asideas.crowdsource.db.hosts=127.0.0.1
> de.asideas.crowdsource.db.port=27017
> de.asideas.crowdsource.db.name=crowdsource
> de.asideas.crowdsource.db.username=crowdsource
> de.asideas.crowdsource.db.password=

You can use a comma seperated list for multiple db-hosts, eg.
> de.asideas.crowdsource.db.hosts=127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2


Mailserver
----------
CrowdSource sends Mails for some occassions. In the example-app a mailserver is started and the mails are exposed via a rest endpoint under /mails.
This is handy for local development as well as integration testing.

For the configuration you need the following entries in your application.properties:
> de.asideas.crowdsource.mail.host=smtp.xyzn.org
> de.asideas.crowdsource.mail.port=587
> de.asideas.crowdsource.mail.username=admin@crowd.yourname.de
> de.asideas.crowdsource.mail.password=
> de.asideas.crowdsource.mail.starttls=true

The default-configuration uses localhost:1025 with no username and no password. StartTls is false per default.

Mail-Templates: There are currently five different templates used for mailing. CrowdSource comes with default templates, but you can just create your own templates.
- activation.template
    This template is the mail sent after you registered your account.
- new-project.template
    This template is send to the administrator after someone created a new project.
- password-forgotten.template
    A mail with the new password link, sent to the user.
- project-published.template
    This mail is sent to the user, after his project was published/accepted.
- project-rejected.template
    This mail is sent to the user, after his project was rejected.


Frontend
--------

During maven build, frontend-maven-plugin will take care of downloading all tools and dependencies required for the frontend build.
To execute manually you will need node/npm. See scripts in package.json for npm.
You will also need to run 'npm install -g karma-cli'.

To be able to develop quickly, run those 2 commands in two separate shells

```
npm run watch
npm run test-watch
```

Tracking
--------

The Crowdsource application supports tracking, utilizing [PIWIK](http://http://piwik.org/) over [Angulartics](https://luisfarzati.github.io/angulartics/).
In order to activate tracking set the following properties in your `application.properties`:
 
 * `de.asideas.crowdsource.tracking.piwik.trackurl=//your-piwik.domain`
 * `de.asideas.crowdsource.tracking.piwik.siteid=1`

This will cause the tracking snippet to be rendered in the index.html.
Tracking includes virtual page views (all the angular anchor links) and the following actions with their respective category:

 * | Rejected   | Projects        
 * | Deferred   | Projects        
 * | Comment    | Projects        
 * | ProjectIdeaSubmitted   | Projects        
 * | ProjectPledged | Projects        
 * | MailToPublisherIconClicked | Projects        
 * | GoToStartNewProjectFromNavbar  | Projects        
 * | GoToStartNewProjectFromTeaser  | Projects        
 * | GoToFinancing  | Projects        
 * | NewFinancingRoundStartedÂ   | FinancingRound 
 * | FinancingRoundAborted  | FinancingRound  
 * | SignIn | UserActions     
 * | SignUp | UserActions     
 * | Logout | UserActions      
 * | AccountActivated   | UserActions     
 * | FaqEntryOpened | UserActions | Label - faq_entry | Value - faq title     
   
In order to decorate HTML elements, like buttons or links with tracking actions just add the following properties to the respective tag:
 * `analytics-on="click"`
 * `analytics-category="<yourCategory>" `
 * `analytics-event="yourEvent"`

Issue Tracking / Feedback Form
-------------------------

The Crowdsource application supports tracking, utilizing the [JIRA issue collector](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/using-the-issue-collector-288657654.html).
In order to activate tracking set the following properties in your `application.properties`:

 * `de.asideas.crowdsource.jira.issuecollector.url=//your-jic.url`

See link above for details on how to get your issue collector setup properly.

AT-Browsers: PHANTOMJS/CHROME/FIREFOX
-------------------------------------

There were some issues with phantomjs. Feel free to give it another try. Maybe its fixed?
Specifiy path to chromedriver/chrome in test.properties to use chrome (environment variable also possible).
Firefox is the fallback. Do nothing and use the worst browser in the world by default.
